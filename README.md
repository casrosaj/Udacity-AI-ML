This repository contains my personal notes and completed projects for
Udacity's 2024 "Space Force Machine Learning Engineer Learning Path"

Description:
This learning path is designed for aspiring or current Machine Learning
Engineers to develop a strong understanding of concepts such as: neural
networks, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning,
reinforcement learning techniques. Upon completion, learners will be able
to build and deploy machine learning models into production.

Nanodegrees awarded in this learning path (in order, marked âœ“ as I complete them):
1. AI Programming with Python
2. Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch
3. Deep Learning
4. Deep Reinforcement Learning
5. Artificial Intelligence
6. Computer Vision
7. Natural Language Processing

Title received after completing learning path:
Machine Learning Engineer
